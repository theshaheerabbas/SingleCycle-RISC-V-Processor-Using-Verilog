# SingleCycle-RISC-V-Processor-Using-Verilog
This repository contains an implementation of a RISC-V processor in Verilog. The RISC-V processor is a simplified implementation based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). It supports a subset of the RISC-V instructions and provides a basic pipeline architecture.
